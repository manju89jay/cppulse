## How to Read This

Each decision follows: **Context** (what problem), **Decision** (what we chose),
**Why** (the real reason), **Tradeoffs** (what we gave up), **Standard Reference**
(if applicable).

---

## D1: libclang over custom parser / Tree-sitter / Clang plugin
- **Context**: Need to parse C++17 for 22 detection rules
- **Decision**: libclang C API
- **Why**: Full semantic AST (resolves types, follows includes), stable ABI across LLVM versions, same parser as Clang compiler
- **Tradeoffs**: Verbose callback-based API, slightly slower than Clang plugin
- **Reference**: ADR-001

## D2: CRTP rule engine over virtual dispatch
- **Context**: 22 rules need polymorphic dispatch during AST walk
- **Decision**: Curiously Recurring Template Pattern
- **Why**: Zero-overhead — no vtable lookup in the hot loop (AST visitor callback runs per-cursor). Rules are statically known.
- **Tradeoffs**: Cannot add rules at runtime, all rules compiled in. Acceptable for v1.0.
- **Interview angle**: "I chose CRTP because the rule set is closed and known at compile time. If rules needed to be loaded dynamically (plugins), I'd switch to virtual dispatch."

## D3: std::variant rule container over type-erasure
- **Context**: Need to store heterogeneous CRTP rule objects in a single container
- **Decision**: std::variant<Rule1, Rule2, ...>
- **Why**: Cache-friendly (no heap allocation), type-safe, compiler-checked exhaustive visitation
- **Tradeoffs**: Closed set; adding a rule requires modifying the variant typedef
- **Interview angle**: "variant gives me value semantics, cache locality, and exhaustive std::visit. For an open plugin system, I'd use std::unique_ptr<RuleInterface>."

## D4: XGBoost over neural networks / logistic regression
- **Context**: Bug prediction from 12 tabular features
- **Decision**: XGBoost gradient-boosted trees
- **Why**: Best performer on tabular data (Kamei et al. 2013), interpretable via SHAP, trains in seconds on CPU
